# Bin-Packing Problem Solver using Evolutionary Algorithm

## Overview

This repository contains Python code to solve Bin-Packing Problems (BPP) using an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA). The EA explores different combinations of crossover operators, mutation strategies, and population sizes to optimize the packing of items into bins.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib (for plotting results)

## How to Use

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

3. **Run the notebook:**

   Open and execute `BPP_CODE.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

## Contents

- `BPP_CODE.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the main code.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview and instructions.

## Experiment Details

The notebook conducts several experiments (Experiment 1 to Experiment 6) to evaluate the EA's performance under different conditions:

- Varying population sizes (10 and 100)
- Different crossover operators (single-point and multi-gene)
- Comparison of mutation strategies

## Results

The notebook generates bar plots showing the best fitness achieved for each experiment, helping to visualize the effectiveness of different parameter configurations.

### About the Code

The `BPP_CODE.ipynb` notebook is structured to analyze and solve Bin-Packing Problems using evolutionary techniques. Each experiment explores a unique combination of parameters to assess the algorithm's performance.

### Experiment Analysis

- **Experiment 1**: Evaluates EA with crossover & operator M1 and population size 10.
- **Experiment 2**: Evaluates EA with crossover & operator M1 and population size 100.
- **Experiment 3**: Evaluates EA with crossover & operator M5 and population size 10.
- **Experiment 4**: Evaluates EA with crossover & operator M5 and population size 100.
- **Experiment 5**: Evaluates EA with only operator M5 and population size 10.
- **Experiment 6**: Evaluates EA with only crossover and population size 10.

Each experiment analyzes the best fitness achieved across multiple trials, providing insights into effective parameter settings for solving BPP.
